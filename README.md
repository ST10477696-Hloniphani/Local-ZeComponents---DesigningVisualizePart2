### Website Development Summary: Features and User Benefits

During the development of the **Local ZeComponents** website, several key features were implemented to improve usability, 
accessibility, and overall user experience. The following summarizes the main additions and their benefits:

 **Consistent Navigation**
   The header and footer were standardized across all pages, including links to Home, About, Services, Enquiry, and Contact. 
   This consistency allows users to move seamlessly between pages, reducing confusion and improving site navigation.

**Responsive Design**
   The website uses flexible containers, grid layouts, and responsive images to ensure that it displays correctly on various devices, 
   including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. This adaptability provides a smooth and visually appealing experience for all users.

**Accessibility Enhancements**
   Features such as skip links, properly structured headings, `aria-labels`, and descriptive alt text for images were included. 
   These improvements make the website accessible to users with disabilities, including those relying on screen readers or keyboard navigation.

**Enquiry and Contact Forms**
   Forms were structured with clear labels, required fields, and functional submit and reset buttons. 
   This enables users to easily get in touch, ask questions, or submit requests, improving communication and building trust with visitors.

**Service and Profile Cards**
   Card layouts were implemented on the Services and Featured Profiles sections to visually organize information. 
   This design allows users to quickly scan and understand the offerings and key features of the website.

**Dynamic Footer Year**
   A small JavaScript snippet automatically updates the copyright year in the footer. This ensures the site appears 
   current and maintained without manual updates, enhancing credibility for users.

**Homepage Link Fixes**
   The homepage link and logo were corrected to point to `index.html`, preventing “page not found” errors. 
   This ensures smooth navigation and reduces user frustration.
